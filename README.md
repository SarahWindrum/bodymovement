MSc Analysis of Machine Learning Potential for Self-Care

The general population have a heightened awareness of the importance of well-being but a lack of understanding in how to manage their own care. The opportunity for machine learning in areas of medicine like diagnostics and clinical trials is well documented. Yet when we see that obesity in the West Midlands alone costs the economy over £4 billion every year, it suggests we should look in other areas of health for new solutions. 
Natasha Lane discusses machine learning as a key technology in the pursuit of ‘wellness’ and I wanted to evaluate how machine learning performs as a methodology for understanding and improving our own care. There is also a commercial driver with the global ‘wellness’ market recently valued at $4.2 trillion and the average British consumer spending close to £500 every year on well-being. 

This analysis examines the potential role for machine learning in managing well-being by evaluating the ability of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to predict activity based on body movements. 

The examination follows the OSEMN Framework utilising data exploration and visualisation techniques in R; data pre-processing techniques including feature scaling and dimensionality reduction; and machine learning methods for multi-classification problems KNeighbours, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and K-Means Clustering all in Python.

The original dataset was from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and there is a sample included here. My code is reproduced in the Appendices above and the final paper is available here [SarahWindrum_7072CEM_Coursework_Final.pdf](https://github.com/SarahWindrum/bodymovement/files/10579179/SarahWindrum_7072CEM_Coursework_Final.pdf)
